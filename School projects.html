				<p>
					Working with 3 other students, I made a game to teach aeronautics to children from 6 to 10 years old and produced a small paper containing recommandation for creating educational entertainment.
				</p>
				<p>
					After learning how to use Unity, I created two small games, the save management and translation modules and half of the game structure and UI.<br>
					Designing, developing and testing the game took about 100 hours of work from each of us including user tests with family and primary schools students.

				<p style="font-style: italic">For this project, I signed a non disclosure agreement, hence I cannot show the result of our work.<br>
					The image above is a moodboard we made to better define what the experience of Daydreaming meant to us. 
					<p>

						<p>
							<strong>Technologies</strong> : Unity with C#<br>
							<strong>Tools </strong> : Blender, GIMP
						</p>

						<p>
							Working with 3 other students and researchers from the <a href="http://www.ruwido.com/">Austrian remote control manufacturer ruwido</a>, we tried to imagine how we could consume videos in the future.
						</p>
						<p>
							This meant researching what already existed and what was likely to change in the future, then brainstorming to find how it could improve the experience video consumption.<br>
							This led us to the experience of Daydreaming : A personal experience that is fully immersive and seamless to enter, you can daydream where you want, at any time and choose what you want to see.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then we designed a system that should provide an experience as close as possible to daydreaming, based on an immersive interface to explore a database of videos and new interactions when watching videos.<br>
							We iterated several times on these ideas, starting from drawings on a whiteboard and ending with an interactive prototype.
							Using this last prototype we conducted tests with 10 users to evaluate the experience and got very positive feedback from them.
						</p>
						<p>
							ruwido is still working on this project and an improved version of our last prototype could be shown at the <a href="http://www.ibc.org/">IBC Trade Show</a> in September 2016.

						<p>
							<strong>Technologies</strong> : Java Swing
						</p>

						<p>
							A small class project where I created a reusable Java component working with a buddy. We had to use an MVC architecture and I had to do some trigonometry to check which parts of the component should respond to user input. 
						</p>

						<!-- Pizza Interface -->

						</h3>
						<img src="images/Pizza.png" width="400" height="250">
						<p>
							<strong>Technologies</strong> : Visual Basic
						</p>

						<p>
							For this project, we designed and created an interface to order pizzas as a team of four. You can filter pizzas using the left side-bar and create your command (there is only one page though).
						</p>
						<p>
							This project was mostly meant to teach us to think about the design choices we made and how to model user tasks

							Thief-Tracker - Master 2<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WuIkjeWHUo">  (video)</a><a href="https://github.com/LeSphax/Thief-Tracker">  (src)</a>
						</h3>
						<img src="images/Thief-Tracker.png" width="450" height="250">
						<p>
							<strong>Technologies</strong> : Android
						</p>

						<p>
							For this project, I created an Android app with a buddy. The app had to detect when the phone would move or when the charger would be unplugged and raise an alarm that a thief shouldn't be able to stop (It wasn't completely possible due to API limitation).
						</p>
						<p>
							This project was interesting because we had to dig into the Android API and search the internet to see what we would and would not be able to do.
						</p>

						<!-- Multimodal Application -->

						</h3>
						<img src="images/Multimodal.png" width="300" height="250">
						<p><strong>Technologies</strong> : Java </p>

						<p>The goal of this project was to learn how we could integrate multiple software each allowing a different way of interacting into a single application.
							<ul>
								<li> A bus-network allowed the different softwares to communicate </li>
								<li>We used voice-recognition software, we had to configure the words it would be able to recognize and we used it to command our app</li>
								<li>We created gesture recognition module with a configurable dictionary of gestures, we also used it to command our app</li>
								<li>We used a drawing module to create and move shapes according to the previous commands</li>
							</ul>
