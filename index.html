<p>I'm developing this game with two friends.</p>

<p>This is a group project I did with 3 other students during the second semester of my 4th year.
The objective was to make a game to teach aeronautics to children from 6 to 10 years old.
Before creating the game we had to produce a small paper on how to make educational entertainment.

Designing, developing and testing the game took about 100 hours of work from each of us including user tests with family and primary schools students.</p>

<p>When I started creating this game, I wanted to create a "I can see the end but I don't seem to get closer" feeling. I also wanted to try to make something which would feel like a level from the game "Antichamber". This is why I then found a quote and turned the level around it.

As it is, it is not really a game, maybe a bad puzzle. I have thought about creating obstacles like projectiles to dodge. The player would have to overcome while going towards the end of the tunnel.

As he would progress he would be able to read messages, these messages would have to feel like self doubt or people discouraging him. "You're making no progress" or "How much time have you been running this way" "Why do you even try"

As he would progress further, the messages would be more obvious and guide him so he could finish the game. "Are there no other options?" "Is this the only way?".</p>
